        <h2>Gymnastics</h2>
        <p>When I was seven, I joined gymnastics with two friends from my 
            primary school.<br> However, I started to dislike it very quickly 
            and quit after a month.</p>

        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        <p>When I was eight, I started Swimming lessons. I later moved onto 
            lifesaving.<br> During this time my mom broke her wrist and was 
            unable to drive me to my lessons.</p>

        <h2>Soccer</h2>
        <p>I joined soccer with my neighbour when I was eleven. I trained every 
            Tuesday and Wednesday evening.<br> I loved training but did not enjoy
            the matches.</p>

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>I joined Togher Running Club when I was fourteen, with my sister and
            our friend.<br> I was trained by one of Rob Heffernan's trainer. 
            Unfortunately, I did not make it to the Olympics.</p>

        <h2>Kickboxing</h2>
        <p>I was seventeen when I joined Kickboxing with one of my school friends.
            Even though she quit after the first training session, <br> I kept it 
            up and ending up winning three gold medals in a kickboxing competition
            in Dublin.</p>
